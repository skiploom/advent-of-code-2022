# :christmas_tree: Advent Of Code 2022

My solutions to the [Advent Of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about)'s daily programming puzzles. This year, I'm using Elixir. :alembic:

## Solutions

:sparkles: [`lib/advent_of_code_2022`](https://github.com/skiploom/advent-of-code-2022/tree/main/lib/advent_of_code_2022) - Check out each day's solution!

:wrench: [`test/`](https://github.com/skiploom/advent-of-code-2022/tree/main/test/) - See their corresponding tests.

## Goals (besides finishing every puzzle, of course!)

1. For each day, reuse as much code between Part 1 and Part 2 as is reasonable.
2. Recursion...recursion everywhere.
